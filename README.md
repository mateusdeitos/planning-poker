# Intro

This is an Planning Poker app that aims to help estimate story points of tasks during the sprint planning (scrum ceremony)

The app uses Firebase Realtime Database's for the realtime communication between users inside a room.

To be able to join a room, the user must sign-in using his Google account

In the app, a user can:
- create a room and invite others
- join a room created by other user
- inside a room, choose a card to vote in a round
- get the average story points defined in a round by the users in the room

# How to run

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
